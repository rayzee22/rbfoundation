    <h3>WHO WE ARE:</h3> <br>
    <h3>The Rauf Badamosi Foundation (RBF) was established in 2022 as a passion-driven charity organisation that focuses on the economic and material empowerment of less-privileged people and underserved communities. RBF is instituted by international businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist, Dr Jimoh Rauf Badamosi, the Chief Executive Officer of JRB Group, in loving memory of his late father, Alhaji Rauf Badamosi.
 
        The late Alhaji Badamosi was a quintessential, honest, peaceful and committed family man who impacted lives positively in his immediate community and the society at large with his humble, simple and sincere life style. A dutiful man of modest means, late Rauf Badamosi was a professional commercial motor driver who believed in hard work and life of contentment. He was guided by the philosophy of live and let live, and was renowned for his peaceful and jovial disposition.
         
        Though originally from Osun State, late Rauf Badamosi grew up and lived his entire life with his family in Ibagwa Aka, Igbo Eze South Local Government Area, Enugu State. As a man who desired a world where peace, harmony and laughter reigned, the Rauf Badamosi Foundation which is committed to creating a peaceful, happy and progressive society with less poverty, hunger and hardship, is a fitting legacy to his loving memory.
         
        The Foundation is duly registered with Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) under the company and allied matters act 1990 of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
